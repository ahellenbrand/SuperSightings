# Super Sightings
Superhero Sightings project for Dev10/Software Guild using Java and Spring.

The web application I made is called "Super Sightings".  It is a fictitious sightings blog/journal that people can use when they spot a superhero.  This crowd-sourcing framework can be applied to many other ideas like: good restaurants to eat at, campsites, and coffee shops.

The technologies used include: MySQL to store the database, Spring Data's JPA Repository to connect the database to Java, the server portion was coded in Java with a Spring MVC controller, and then Spring's Thymeleaf was used to dynamically generate the HTML webpages.
